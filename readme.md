# I'm Michael

I'm a creative Web Developer with a passion for building modern web experiences using React, Gatsby GraphQL and the JAMStack. I have commercial agency experience building client sites with Javascript, Craft CMS, Twig, Tailwind, BEM and GSAP.

I love to push boundaries and work with new technologies like Three.js, WebGL, page transitions and SVG animations.
