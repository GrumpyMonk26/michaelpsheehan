# I'm Michael

I'm a creative Web Developer with a passion for building modern web experiences using React, Gatsby GraphQL and the JAMStack. I have commercial agency experience building client sites with Javascript, Craft CMS, Twig, Tailwind, BEM and GSAP.

I love to push boundaries and work with the newest innovations like Three.js, WebGL, page transitions and SVG animations. 

Check out my portfolio below for examples of my work.

For any inquires contact me through my site, LinkedIn or Twitter.
